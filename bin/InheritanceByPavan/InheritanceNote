four type
1.single  :
2.multi level :
3.hierachy : 
4.multiple 

single level inheritance
In which there is two clas one is parent class and second is child class
i.e parent class extends child class

multi level inheritance
in which parent class extends child class and child class extend another child class
A extends B extends C

so this is called multi level inheritance


hierarchyInheritance
In which one parent class can extends multiple child class

eg. Parent extends child1 
    Parent extends child2
    Parent extends child3
And if you create the object of any class then you can acess the variable and method 
present in child and parent class
