Variable:
instance variable/class variable
local variable
static variable

Classes and object : 
like getting the properties i.e variable and method from one class to another class
by creating the object of class in main class and printing the method present inside 
that class
we can used inheritance concept to call the other methods which are present in some other class
for that we need to use the extends keywords

Constructor:
Type of constructor
1.default constructor : its by default hidden java will write that constructor
2.Parameterize constructor: explicitly defined so we need to pass the parameter for that const.
3.copy constructor : assinging the value of another constructor to main 

call byvalue and call by reference
callbyvalue: main number will not change
callbyreference main number will change
