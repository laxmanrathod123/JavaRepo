call by value

in this we are just passing the copy of the value not 
not original number
and the other method use by that value they can modify 
the value by adding some number to it  

eg. Notebook original copy -> make a multiple copy

distribute that multiple copy to multiple student 
but original copy should not changed 


when you passed variable original value should not impacted
when you passed reference/object original value should be impacted

call by value original value impacted 
call by reference original value not impacted
